# Archipelago apworld and client for arbitrary to-do lists!

## How it works:
### 'Tasks' and 'Rewards'
* In the client's YAML generator, you'll be able to input 'Tasks' and 'Rewards'.
* Tasks are the checks you'll need to mark complete on the client's todo list.
* Rewards are the items that are shuffled into the multi-world to match those spots

### DeathLink:
* If death link is enabled, the user can provide a list of random tasks or punishments that go off whenever the client receives a death link
* I recommend things like "10 pushups" or "Tidy one thing in your room" or "Read 2 pages of a book for school". Things like that.

## Setup:
* Download taskipelago.apworld and taskipelago.exe from the releases page.
* Place taskipelago.apworld in the custom_worlds folder of your archipelago install
* Use taskipelago.exe to generate a yaml to place in your host's Players folder
* Once the server is up, you can join from the client.
* Congrats, you've got it up and running!

I made this mostly for myself to be motivated to do my grad school stuff lol. Will maybe make it better later, but the goal for now is functional.
