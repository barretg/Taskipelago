# Archipelago apworld and client for arbitrary to-do lists!

## How it works:
### 'Tasks' and 'Rewards'
* In the client's YAML generator, you'll be able to input 'Tasks' and 'Rewards'.
* Tasks are the checks (locations) you'll need to mark complete on the client's todo list.
* Rewards are the items that are shuffled into the multi-world to match those spots
* Tasks can be prerequisite on the completion of other tasks or rewards. It is recommended to set up some hierarchy with this, as otherwise all checks will be in sphere 1.

### DeathLink:
* If DeathLink is enabled, the user can provide a list of random tasks or punishments that go off whenever the client receives a death link
* I recommend things like "10 pushups" or "Tidy one thing in your room" or "Read 2 pages of a book" or "1 minute plank". Things like that.

## Setup:
* Download taskipelago.apworld from the releases page.
* Place taskipelago.apworld in the custom_worlds folder of your archipelago install
* Launch the client from archipelago and use it to generate a yaml to place in your host's Players folder
* Once the server is up, you can join from the client.
* Congrats, you've got it up and running!

I made this mostly for myself to be motivated to do my grad school stuff lol. Will maybe make it better later, but the goal for now is functional.
