## I am bad at organization but that's why I made this in the first place

so yeah i'm dumping todos here in a big sloppy mess
what are you gonna do about it?
take that Jira.

* Fix it reloading every time you complete a task
* Optimize, it can be quite laggy when lots of tasks.
* Add proper archipelago text console window (separate tab?)
* Notification history
* tasklock integration to force all task locks to be in the taskipelago world (generate tasklock yaml with plando logic included, warn user to enable plando items in host.yaml)
* Designate a "Goal" task
