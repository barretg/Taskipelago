## I am bad at organization but that's why I made this in the first place

so yeah i'm dumping todos here in a big sloppy mess
what are you gonna do about it?
take that Jira.


* Fix the reward thingy to show an actual player name rather than "player #"
* Add a scrolling pane of incoming rewards and death links rather than evil pop-ups
* fix it reloading every time you complete a task
* optimize, it is very laggy when lots of tasks.
* make it store the last server and slot that was connected to and auto-fill that info
* add a reset button to yaml generator
