## I am bad at organization but that's why I made this in the first place

so yeah i'm dumping todos here in a big sloppy mess
what are you gonna do about it?
take that Jira.


* Fix the reward thingy to show an actual player name rather than "player #"
* fix it reloading every time you complete a task
* optimize, it is very laggy when lots of tasks.
* make it store the last server and slot that was connected to and auto-fill that info
* add a reset button to yaml generator
* add notification for what item was sent out when completing a task for ease of use
* add proper text console window (separate tab?)
* notification history
* prerequisite rewards for tasks (i.e. "Progressive Broom" lol)
* mark rewards as traps, junk, useful, progression
* tasklock integration to force all task locks to be in the taskipelago world (generate tasklock yaml with plando logic included, warn user to enable plando items in host.yaml)
